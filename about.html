  <h1>About Me   </h1>
    
  <p> 
    My name is Marcin Walczak, and I'm currently an undergraduate English major in my junior year at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.<br> <br>
    As an entry-level technical writer, my goal is to convey what is necessary to the target market with the utmost clarity. Though this goal may seem simple, I make every effort to produce quality documentation, from research to grammatical consistency. <br> <br>
      
    Thus far, I am proficient in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, Microsoft Office and Javascript. I also have sufficient experience working with Git and Github repositories, and I am familiar with several style guides such as the Chicago, IBM, and AP style guides. However, technical writing demands that you are always learning new technology and terminology, so I am always eager and quick to learn something new, whether it be software or a specialized communication platform exclusive to one company. Research and adaptability are one of the first skills I acquired when I chose to be a technical writer, and it serves as the foundation for my writing. <br> <br>
    
    Working both with large -scale open-source projects and individual software engineers, I have an understanding of how developer environments communicate and collaborate with each other through forums, branching, and one-to-one communication. Research constitutes a large part of the technical writing experience, and it is something I place great emphasis on in my work. <br> <br>
    
    I have experience writing documentation for Open Source projects such as Fedora, as well as successful programs used within specialized industries. You can check out these samples in my Portfolio tab. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via the email form in my contact section.
